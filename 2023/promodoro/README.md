Promodoro Timer:

I wanted a Local Promodoro Tomato Timer, this is the result:

- [ ] TODO: Generate Thumbnail

Dependencies:
- Requires pygame for GUI.
- A .ttf file required in same directory to render text.

Other TODO:
- [ ] Tomato Image, the timer lacks the juice.
- [ ] Interactive buttons: Play, Pause, Reset, Skip.
- [ ] Timeline to visualize the current stage of the series.
