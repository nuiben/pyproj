# Google It Automation with Python

This repo serves as a collection of practical IT projects to solve problems similar to those experienced by IT professionals in the real world.

## Module 1 Project: Image Processor

To complete this module, you'll need to write a script that processes a bunch of images. It turns out that your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create some new icon graphics for the site. However, the contractor has delivered the final designs and they’re in the wrong format, rotated 90° and too large. You’re unable to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch!

## Module 2 Project: Serialized Reviews

To complete this module, you'll write a script that interacts with a running web service.  The web service is part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying the customer reviews of the company.

The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.
