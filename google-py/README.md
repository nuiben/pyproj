# Google IT Automation with Python

This repo serves as a collection of practical IT projects to solve problems similar to those experienced by IT professionals in the real world.

## Module 1 Project: Image Processor

To complete this module, you'll need to write a script that processes a bunch of images. It turns out that your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create some new icon graphics for the site. However, the contractor has delivered the final designs and they’re in the wrong format, rotated 90° and too large. You’re unable to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch!

## Module 2 Project: Serialized Reviews

To complete this module, you'll write a script that interacts with a running web service.  The web service is part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying the customer reviews of the company.

The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.

## Module 3 Project: PDF Converter

It's that time again, time to flex your programming muscles and practice solving a real-life problem with the skills you acquired!

In the next lab, you'll have to process information related to the sales your company generated last month, and turn that into a nicely formatted PDF report that you'll then send by email so that your boss can look at it. The lab machine has email configured so that you can check your resulting emails through a nice webmail interface that's already up and running.

## Module 4 Project: Fruit Store

You work for an online fruit store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with data provided by your suppliers. When each supplier has new products for your store, they give you an image and a description of each product. Given a bunch of images and descriptions of each of the new products, you’ll:
- Upload the new products to your online store. Images and descriptions should be uploaded separately, using two different web endpoints.
- Send a report back to the supplier, letting them know what you imported.
- Since this process is key to your business's success, you need to make sure that it keeps running! So, you’ll also:
    - Run a script on your web server to monitor system health.
    - Send an email with an alert if the server is ever unhealthy.
